"1","On the Complexity of Community-aware Network Sparsification","Emanuel Herrendorf, Christian Komusiewicz, Nils Morawietz, Frank Sommer","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Network sparsification is the task of reducing the number of edges of a given graph while preserving some crucial graph property. In communityaware network sparsification, the preserved property concerns the subgraphs that are induced by the communities of the graph which are given as vertex subsets. This is formalized in the PiNetwork Sparsification problem given an edgeweighted graph G, a collection Z of c subsets of VG communities, and two numbers ell, b, the question is whether there exists a spanning subgraph G of G with at most ell edges of total weight at most b such that GC fulfills Pi for each community C. Here, we consider two graph properties Pi the connectivity property Connectivity NWS and the property of having a spanning star Stars NWS. Since both problems are NPhard, we study their parameterized and finegrained complexity. We provide a tight 2Omegan2c polynZtime running time lower bound based on the ETH for both problems, where n is the number of vertices in G. The lower bound holds even in the restricted case when all communities have size at most 4, G is a clique, and every edge has unit weight. For the connectivity property, the unit weight case with G being a clique is the wellstudied problem of computing a hypergraph support with a minimum number of edges. We then study the complexity of both problems parameterized by the feedback edge number t of the solution graph G. For Stars NWS, we present an XPalgorithm for t. This answers an open question by Korach and Stern Disc. Appl. Math. 08 who asked for the existence of polynomialtime algorithms for t0. In contrast, we show for Connectivity NWS that known polynomialtime algorithms for t0 Korach and Stern, Math. Program. 03 Klemz et al., SWAT 14 cannot be extended by showing that Connectivity NWS is NPhard for t1.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:32:39 UTC (165 KB)"
"2","Graph Partitioning With Limited Moves","Majid Behbahani, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Elaheh Fata, Yuriy Nevmyvaka","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","In many real world networks, there already exists a not necessarily optimal kpartitioning of the network. Oftentimes, one aims to find a kpartitioning with a smaller cut value for such networks by moving only a few nodes across partitions. The number of nodes that can be moved across partitions is often a constraint forced by budgetary limitations. Motivated by such realworld applications, we introduce and study the rmove kpartitioningproblem, a natural variant of the Multiway cut problem. Given a graph, a set of k terminals and an initial partitioning of the graph, the rmove kpartitioningproblem aims to find a kpartitioning with the minimumweighted cut among all the kpartitionings that can be obtained by moving at most r nonterminal nodes to partitions different from their initial ones. Our main result is a polynomial time 3r1 approximation algorithm for this problem. We further show that this problem is W1hard, and give an FPTAS for when r is a small constant.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:25:54 UTC (757 KB)"
"3","Lasso with Latents: Efficient Estimation, Covariate Rescaling, and Computational-Statistical Gaps","Jonathan Kelner, Frederic Koehler, Raghu Meka, Dhruv Rohatgi","Machine Learning (stat.ML)","It is wellknown that the statistical performance of Lasso can suffer significantly when the covariates of interest have strong correlations. In particular, the prediction error of Lasso becomes much worse than computationally inefficient alternatives like Best Subset Selection. Due to a large conjectured computationalstatistical tradeoff in the problem of sparse linear regression, it may be impossible to close this gap in general. In this work, we propose a natural sparse linear regression setting where strong correlations between covariates arise from unobserved latent variables. In this setting, we analyze the problem caused by strong correlations and design a surprisingly simple fix. While Lasso with standard normalization of covariates fails, there exists a heterogeneous scaling of the covariates with which Lasso will suddenly obtain strong provable guarantees for estimation. Moreover, we design a simple, efficient procedure for computing such a smart scaling. The sample complexity of the resulting rescaled Lasso algorithm incurs in the worst case quadratic dependence on the sparsity of the underlying signal. While this dependence is not informationtheoretically necessary, we give evidence that it is optimal among the class of polynomialtime algorithms, via the method of lowdegree polynomials. This argument reveals a new connection between sparse linear regression and a special version of sparse PCA with a nearcritical negative spike. The latter problem can be thought of as a realvalued analogue of learning a sparse parity. Using it, we also establish the first computationalstatistical gap for the closely related problem of learning a Gaussian Graphical Model.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:16:38 UTC (285 KB)"
"4","Tight Approximation and Kernelization Bounds for Vertex-Disjoint Shortest Paths","Matthias Bentert, Fedor V. Fomin, Petr A. Golovach","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We examine the possibility of approximating Maximum VertexDisjoint Shortest Paths. In this problem, the input is an edgeweighted directed or undirected nvertex graph G along with k terminal pairs s1,t1,s2,t2,ldots,sk,tk. The task is to connect as many terminal pairs as possible by pairwise vertexdisjoint paths such that each path is a shortest path between the respective terminals. Our work is anchored in the recent breakthrough by Lochet SODA 21, which demonstrates the polynomialtime solvability of the problem for a fixed value of k. Lochets result implies the existence of a polynomialtime ckapproximation for Maximum VertexDisjoint Shortest Paths, where c leq 1 is a constant. Our first result suggests that this approximation algorithm is, in a sense, the best we can hope for. More precisely, assuming the gapETH, we exclude the existence of an okapproximations within fk cdot polyn time for any function f that only depends on k. Our second result demonstrates the infeasibility of achieving an approximation ratio of nfrac12varepsilon in polynomial time, unless P  NP. It is not difficult to show that a greedy algorithm selecting a path with the minimum number of arcs results in a lceilsqrtellrceilapproximation, where ell is the number of edges in all the paths of an optimal solution. Since ell leq n, this underscores the tightness of the nfrac12varepsiloninapproximability bound. Additionally, we establish that Maximum VertexDisjoint Shortest Paths is fixedparameter tractable when parameterized by ell but does not admit a polynomial kernel. Our hardness results hold for undirected graphs with unit weights, while our positive results extend to scenarios where the input graph is directed and features arbitrary nonnegative edge weights.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:31:52 UTC (25 KB)"
"5","Platforms for Efficient and Incentive-Aware Collaboration","Nika Haghtalab, Mingda Qiao, Kunhe Yang","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Collaboration is crucial for reaching collective goals. However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the strategic behavior of individual agents  a fact that is captured by a high Price of Stability PoS in recent literature Blum et al., 2021. Implicit in the traditional PoS analysis is the assumption that agents have full knowledge of how their tasks relate to one another. We offer a new perspective on bringing about efficient collaboration among strategic agents using information design. Inspired by the growing importance of collaboration in machine learning such as platforms for collaborative federated learning and data cooperatives, we propose a framework where the platform has more information about how the agents tasks relate to each other than the agents themselves. We characterize how and to what degree such platforms can leverage their information advantage to steer strategic agents toward efficient collaboration. Concretely, we consider collaboration networks where each node is a task type held by one agent, and each task benefits from contributions made in their inclusive neighborhood of tasks. This network structure is known to the agents and the platform, but only the platform knows each agents real location  from the agents perspective, their location is determined by a random permutation. We employ private Bayesian persuasion and design two families of persuasive signaling schemes that the platform can use to ensure a small total workload when agents follow the signal. The first family aims to achieve the minmax optimal approximation ratio compared to the optimal collaboration, which is shown to be Thetasqrtn for unitweight graphs, Thetan23 for graphs with constant minimum edge weights, and On34 for general weighted graphs. The second family ensures perinstance strict improvement compared to full information disclosure.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:04:23 UTC (62 KB)"
"6","Algorithmically Fair Maximization of Multiple Submodular Objective Functions","Georgios Amanatidis, Georgios Birmpas, Philip Lazos, Stefano Leonardi, Rebecca Reiffenh√§user","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Constrained maximization of submodular functions poses a central problem in combinatorial optimization. In many realistic scenarios, a number of agents need to maximize multiple submodular objectives over the same ground set. We study such a setting, where the different solutions must be disjoint, and thus, questions of fairness arise. Inspired from the fair division literature, we suggest a simple roundrobin protocol, where agents are allowed to build their solutions one item at a time by taking turns. Unlike what is typical in fair division, however, the prime goal here is to provide a fair algorithmic environment each agent is allowed to use any algorithm for constructing their respective solutions. We show that just by following simple greedy policies, agents have solid guarantees for both monotone and nonmonotone objectives, and for combinatorial constraints as general as psystems which capture cardinality and matroid intersection constraints. In the monotone case, our results include approximate EF1type guarantees and their implications in fair division may be of independent interest. Further, although following a greedy policy may not be optimal in general, we show that consistently performing better than that is computationally hard.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 07:37:05 UTC (389 KB)"
"7","The Cost of Parallelizing Boosting","Xin Lyu, Hongxun Wu, Junzhao Yang","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We study the cost of parallelizing weaktostrong boosting algorithms for learning, following the recent work of Karbasi and Larsen. Our main results are twofold  First, we prove a tight lower bound, showing that even slight parallelization of boosting requires an exponential blowup in the complexity of training. Specifically, let gamma be the weak learners advantage over random guessing. The famous textscAdaBoost algorithm produces an accurate hypothesis by interacting with the weak learner for tildeO1  gamma2 rounds where each round runs in polynomial time. Karbasi and Larsen showed that significant parallelization must incur exponential blowup Any boosting algorithm either interacts with the weak learner for Omega1  gamma rounds or incurs an expd  gamma blowup in the complexity of training, where d is the VC dimension of the hypothesis class. We close the gap by showing that any boosting algorithm either has Omega1  gamma2 rounds of interaction or incurs a smaller exponential blowup of expd. Complementing our lower bound, we show that there exists a boosting algorithm using tildeO1t gamma2 rounds, and only suffer a blowup of expd cdot t2. Plugging in t  omega1, this shows that the smaller blowup in our lower bound is tight. More interestingly, this provides the first tradeoff between the parallelism and the total work required for boosting.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 07:03:52 UTC (25 KB)"
"8","The Umeyama algorithm for matching correlated Gaussian geometric models in the low-dimensional regime","Shuyang Gong, Zhangsong Li","Statistics Theory (math.ST)","Motivated by the problem of matching two correlated random geometric graphs, we study the problem of matching two Gaussian geometric models correlated through a latent node permutation. Specifically, given an unknown permutation pi on 1,ldots,n and given n i.i.d. pairs of correlated Gaussian vectors Xpii,Yi in mathbbRd with noise parameter sigma, we consider two types of correlated weighted complete graphs with edge weights given by Ai,jlangle Xi,Xj rangle, Bi,jlangle Yi,Yj rangle. The goal is to recover the hidden vertex correspondence pi based on the observed matrices A and B. For the lowdimensional regime where dOlog n, Wang, Wu, Xu, and Yolou WWXY22 established the information thresholds for exact and almost exact recovery in matching correlated Gaussian geometric models. They also conducted numerical experiments for the classical Umeyama algorithm. In our work, we prove that this algorithm achieves exact recovery of pi when the noise parameter sigmaod3n2d, and almost exact recovery when sigmaod3n1d. Our results approach the information thresholds up to a operatornamepolyd factor in the lowdimensional regime.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 04:58:54 UTC (32 KB)"
"9","Tight Inapproximability of Target Set Reconfiguration","Naoto Ohsaka","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Given a graph G with a vertex threshold function tau, consider a dynamic process in which any inactive vertex v becomes activated whenever at least tauv of its neighbors are activated. A vertex set S is called a target set if all vertices of G would be activated when initially activating vertices of S. In the Minmax Target Set Reconfiguration problem, for a graph G and its two target sets X and Y, we wish to transform X into Y by repeatedly adding or removing a single vertex, using only target sets of G, so as to minimize the maximum size of any intermediate target set. We prove that it is NPhard to approximate Minmax Target Set Reconfiguration within a factor of 2oleftfrac1operatornamepolylog nright, where n is the number of vertices. Our result establishes a tight lower bound on approximability of Minmax Target Set Reconfiguration, which admits a 2factor approximation algorithm. The proof is based on a gappreserving reduction from Target Set Selection to Minmax Target Set Reconfiguration, where NPhardness of approximation for the former problem is proven by Chen SIAM J.

"10","Repro Samples Method for a Performance Guaranteed Inference in General and Irregular Inference Problems","Minge Xie, Peng Wang","Methodology (stat.ME)","Rapid advancements in data science require us to have fundamentally new frameworks to tackle prevalent but highly nontrivial irregular inference problems, to which the large sample central limit theorem does not apply. Typical examples are those involving discrete or nonnumerical parameters and those involving nonnumerical data, etc. In this article, we present an innovative, widereaching, and effective approach, called repro samples method, to conduct statistical inference for these irregular problems plus more. The development relates to but improves several existing simulationinspired inference approaches, and we provide both exact and approximate theories to support our development. Moreover, the proposed approach is broadly applicable and subsumes the classical NeymanPearson framework as a special case. For the oftenseen irregular inference problems that involve both discretenonnumerical and continuous parameters, we propose an effective threestep procedure to make inferences for all parameters. We also develop a unique matching scheme that turns the discreteness of discretenonnumerical parameters from an obstacle for forming inferential theories into a beneficial attribute for improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed general methodology using various examples, including a case study example on a Gaussian mixture model with unknown number of components. This case study example provides a solution to a longstanding open inference question in statistics on how to quantify the estimation uncertainty for the unknown number of components and other associated parameters. Real data and simulation studies, with comparisons to existing approaches, demonstrate the far superior performance of the proposed method.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 22:43:42 UTC (384 KB)"
"11","Parallel Approximate Maximum Flows in Near-Linear Work and Polylogarithmic Depth","Arpit Agarwal, Sanjeev Khanna, Huan Li, Prathamesh Patil, Chen Wang, Nathan White, Peilin Zhong","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We present a parallel algorithm for the 1epsilonapproximate maximum flow problem in capacitated, undirected graphs with n vertices and m edges, achieving Oepsilon3textpolylog n depth and Om epsilon3 textpolylog n work in the PRAM model. Although nearlinear time sequential algorithms for this problem have been known for almost a decade, no parallel algorithms that simultaneously achieved polylogarithmic depth and nearlinear work were known. At the heart of our result is a polylogarithmic depth, nearlinear work recursive algorithm for computing congestion approximators. Our algorithm involves a recursive step to obtain a lowquality congestion approximator followed by a boosting step to improve its quality which prevents a multiplicative blowup in error. Similar to Peng SODA16, our boosting step builds upon the hierarchical decomposition scheme of Rcke, Shah, and Tubig SODA14. A direct implementation of this approach, however, leads only to an algorithm with no1 depth and m1o1 work. To get around this, we introduce a new hierarchical decomposition scheme, in which we only need to solve maximum flows on subgraphs obtained by contracting vertices, as opposed to vertexinduced subgraphs used in Rcke, Shah, and Tubig SODA14. In particular, we are able to directly extract congestion approximators for the subgraphs from a congestion approximator for the entire graph, thereby avoiding additional recursion on those subgraphs. Along the way, we also develop a parallel flowdecomposition algorithm that is crucial to achieving polylogarithmic depth and may be of independent interest.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 20:23:59 UTC (97 KB)"
"12","Hitting Meets Packing: How Hard Can it Be?","Jacob Focke, Fabian Frei, Shaohua Li, D√°niel Marx, Philipp Schepper, Roohani Sharma, Karol Wƒôgrzycki","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We study a general family of problems that form a common generalization of classic hitting also referred to as covering or transversal and packing problems. An instance of XHitPack asks Can removing k deletable vertices of a graph G prevent us from packing ell vertexdisjoint objects of type X? This problem captures a spectrum of problems with standard hitting and packing on opposite ends. Our main motivating question is whether the combination XHitPack can be significantly harder than these two base problems. Already for a particular choice of X, this question can be posed for many different complexity notions, leading to a large, sofar unexplored domain in the intersection of the areas of hitting and packing problems. On a highlevel, we present two case studies 1 X being all cycles, and 2 X being all copies of a fixed graph H. In each, we explore the classical complexity, as well as the parameterized complexity with the natural parameters kl and treewidth. We observe that the combined problem can be drastically harder than the base problems for cycles or for H being a connected graph with at least 3 vertices, the problem is Sigma2Pcomplete and requires doubleexponential dependence on the treewidth of the graph assuming the ExponentialTime Hypothesis. In contrast, the combined problem admits qualitatively similar running times as the base problems in some cases, although significant novel ideas are required. For example, for X being all cycles, we establish a 2polyklnO1 algorithm using an involved branching method. Also, for X being all edges i.e., H  K2 this combines Vertex Cover and Maximum Matching the problem can be solved in time 2polytwnO1 on graphs of treewidth tw. The key step enabling this running time relies on a combinatorial bound obtained from an algebraic linear deltamatroid representation of possible matchings.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 19:19:52 UTC (417 KB)"

Pissis, Jakub Radoszewski, Wojciech Rytter, Tomasz Wale≈Ñ, Wiktor Zuba","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","In the kEdit Circular Pattern Matching kEdit CPM problem, we are given a lengthn text T, a lengthm pattern P, and a positive integer threshold k, and we are to report all starting positions of the substrings of T that are at edit distance at most k from some cyclic rotation of P. In the decision version of the problem, we are to check if any such substring exists. Very recently, Charalampopoulos et al. ESA 2022 presented Onk2time and Onk log3 ktime solutions for the reporting and decision versions of kEdit CPM, respectively. Here, we show that the reporting and decision versions of kEdit CPM can be solved in Onnm k6 time and Onnm k5 log3 k time, respectively, thus obtaining the first algorithms with a complexity of the type Onnm mathrmpolyk for this problem. Notably, our algorithms run in On time when mOmegak6 and are superior to the previous respective solutions when momegak4. We provide a metaalgorithm that yields efficient algorithms in several other interesting settings, such as when the strings are given in a compressed form as straightline programs, when the strings are dynamic, or when we have a quantum computer. We obtain our solutions by exploiting the structure of approximate circular occurrences of P in T, when T is relatively short w.r.t. P. Roughly speaking, either the starting positions of approximate occurrences of rotations of P form Ok4 intervals that can be computed efficiently, or some rotation of P is almost periodic is at a small edit distance from a string with small period. Dealing with the almost periodic case is the most technically demanding part of this work we tackle it using properties of locked fragments originating from Cole and Hariharan, SICOMP 2002.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 13:42:47 UTC (280 KB)"

These largescale clinical data, collectively referred to as realworld data RWD. It is expected to be widely used in largescale observational studies of specific diseases, personal medicine or precise medicine, finding the responder of drugs or treatments. Applying RWD for estimating heterogeneous treat ment effect HTE has already been a trending topic. HTE has the potential to considerably impact the development of precision medicine by helping doctors make more informed precise treatment decisions and provide more personalized medical care.

For d1, this corresponds to the classical Interval Scheduling problem, where a simple greedy algorithm returns an optimal solution. In the offline setting, for ddimensional hyperrectangles, polynomial time log nOdapproximation algorithms are known. However, the problem becomes notably challenging in the online setting, where the input objects hyperrectangles appear one by one in an adversarial order, and on the arrival of an object, the algorithm needs to make an immediate and irrevocable decision whether or not to select the object while maintaining the feasibility. Even for interval scheduling, an Omegan lower bound is known on the competitive ratio. To circumvent these negative results, in this work, we study the online maximum independent set of axisaligned hyperrectangles in the randomorder arrival model, where the adversary specifies the set of input objects which then arrive in a uniformly random order. Starting from the prototypical secretary problem, the randomorder model has received significant attention to study algorithms beyond the worstcase competitive analysis. Surprisingly, we show that the problem in the randomorder model almost matches the bestknown offline approximation guarantees, up to polylogarithmic factors. In particular, we give a simple log nOdcompetitive algorithm for ddimensional hyperrectangles in this model, which runs in tildeOdn time. Our approach also yields log nOdcompetitive algorithms in the randomorder model for more general objects such as ddimensional fat objects and ellipsoids.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 01:04:18 UTC (47 KB)"

The workloads are inefficient on hardware designed for dense computations and do not map well onto sparse data representations. We build a vectorized and parallel matrixmultiplication system A X B  C that eliminates unnecessary computations and avoids branches based on a runtime evaluation of sparsity. We use a combination of dynamic code lookup to adapt to the specific sparsity encoded in the B matrix and preprocessing of sparsity maps of the A and B matrices to compute conditional branches once for the whole computation. For a wide range of sparsity, from 60 to 95 zeros, our implementation performs fewer instructions and increases performance when compared with Intel MKLs dense or sparse matrix multiply routines. Benefits can be as large as 2 times speedup and 4 times fewer instructions.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 20:36:08 UTC (823 KB)"

This misalignment makes it difficult to effectively learn to rank items, as it may hinder exploration of items with greater longterm payoffs. Our paper tackles this issue by utilizing users limited attention spans. We propose a model where a platform presents items with unknown payoffs to the platform in a ranked list to T users over time. Each user selects an item by first considering a prefix window of these ranked items and then picking the highest preferred item in that window and the platform observes its payoff for this item. We study the design of online bandit algorithms that obtain vanishing regret against hindsight optimal benchmarks. We first consider adversarial window sizes and stochastic iid payoffs. We design an activeeliminationbased algorithm that achieves an optimal instancedependent regret bound of OlogT, by showing matching regret upper and lower bounds. The key idea is using the combinatorial structure of the problem to either obtain a large payoff from each item or to explore by getting a sample from that item. This method systematically narrows down the item choices to enhance learning efficiency and payoff. Second, we consider adversarial payoffs and stochastic iid window sizes. We start from the fullinformation problem of finding the permutation that maximizes the expected payoff. By a novel combinatorial argument, we characterize the polytope of admissible item selection probabilities by a permutation and show it has a polynomialsize representation. Using this representation, we show how standard algorithms for adversarial online linear optimization in the space of admissible probabilities can be used to obtain a polynomialtime algorithm with OsqrtT regret.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 18:52:20 UTC (45 KB)"

"26","On Distributed Computation of the Minimum Triangle Edge Transversal","Keren Censor-Hillel, Majd Khoury","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)","The distance of a graph from being trianglefree is a fundamental graph parameter, counting the number of edges that need to be removed from a graph in order for it to become trianglefree. Its corresponding computational problem is the classic minimum triangle edge transversal problem, and its normalized value is the baseline for trianglefreeness testing algorithms. While trianglefreeness testing has been successfully studied in the distributed setting, computing the distance itself in a distributed setting is unknown, to the best of our knowledge, despite being wellstudied in the centralized setting. This work addresses the computation of the minimum triangle edge transversal in distributed networks. We show with a simple warmup construction that this is a global task, requiring OmegaD rounds even in the mathsfLOCAL model with unbounded messages, where D is the diameter of the network. However, we show that approximating this value can be done much faster. A 1epsilonapproximation can be obtained in textpolylogn rounds, where n is the size of the network graph. Moreover, faster approximations can be obtained, at the cost of increasing the approximation factor to roughly 3, by a reduction to the minimum hypergraph vertex cover problem. With a time overhead of the maximum degree Delta, this can also be applied to the mathsfCONGEST model, in which messages are bounded. Our key technical contribution is proving that computing an exact solution is as hard as it gets in mathsfCONGEST, requiring a nearquadratic number of rounds. Because this problem is an edge selection problem, as opposed to previous lower bounds that were for node selection problems, major challenges arise in constructing the lower bound, requiring us to develop novel ingredients.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 18:14:24 UTC (1,145 KB)"

The question we study is does the computational threshold for robust community recovery also lie at the KS threshold? We answer this question affirmatively, providing an algorithm for robust community recovery for arbitrary stochastic block models on any constant number of communities, generalizing the work of Ding, dOrsi, Nasser  Steurer on an efficient algorithm above the KS threshold in the case of 2community block models.

Classically, genome assembly uses assembly graphs built using this set of substrings to compute the source string efficiently, having a tradeoff between scalability and avoiding information loss. The scalable de Bruijn graphs come at the price of losing crucial overlap information. The complete overlap information is stored in overlap graphs using quadratic space. Hierarchical overlap graphs IPL20 HOG overcome these limitations, avoiding information loss despite using linear space. After a series of suboptimal improvements, Khan and Park et al. simultaneously presented two optimal algorithms CPM2021, where only the former was seemingly practical. We empirically analyze all the practical algorithms for computing HOG, where the optimal algorithm CPM2021 outperforms the previous algorithms as expected, though at the expense of extra memory. However, it uses nonintuitive approach and nontrivial data structures. We present arguably the most intuitive algorithm, using only elementary arrays, which is also optimal. Our algorithm empirically proves even better for both time and memory over all the algorithms, highlighting its significance in both theory and practice. We further explore the applications of hierarchical overlap graphs to solve various forms of suffixprefix queries on a set of strings. Loukides et al.

Within this context, gerrymandering is the practice of drawing these boundaries such that they unfairly favor a particular political party, often leading to unequal representation and skewed electoral outcomes. One of the few ways to detect gerrymandering is by algorithmically sampling redistricting plans. Previous methods mainly focus on sampling from some neighborhood of realistic districting plans, rather than a uniform sample of the entire space. We present a deterministic subexponential time algorithm to uniformly sample from the space of all possible  k partitions of a bounded degree planar graph, and with this construct a sample of the entire space of redistricting plans. We also give a way to restrict this sample space to plans that match certain compactness and population constraints at the cost of added complexity. The algorithm runs in  2Osqrtnlog n  time, although we only give a heuristic implementation.

Here we propose a model for the formation of such networks and the transfer of opportunities within them. In our theoretical model, individuals strategically connect with others to maximize the probability that they receive opportunities from them. We explore how professional networks balance connectivity, where connections facilitate opportunity transfers to those who did not get them from outside sources, and congestion, where some individuals receive too many opportunities from their connections and waste some of them. We show that strategic individuals are overconnected at equilibrium relative to a social optimum, leading to a price of anarchy for which we derive nearly tight asymptotic bounds. We also show that, at equilibrium, individuals form connections to those who provide similar benefit to them as they provide to others. Thus, our model provides a microfoundation in professional networking contexts for the fundamental sociological principle of homophily, that similarity breeds connection, which in our setting is realized as a form of status homophily based on alignment in individual benefit. We further explore how, even if individuals are a priori equally likely to receive opportunities from outside sources, equilibria can be unequal, and we provide nearly tight bounds on how unequal they can be. Finally, we explore the ability for online platforms to intervene to improve social welfare and show that natural heuristics may result in adverse effects at equilibrium. Our simple model allows for a surprisingly rich analysis of coordination problems in professional networks and suggests many directions for further exploration.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 14:38:37 UTC (6,769 KB)"

The Adaptive Massively Parallel Computation AMPC is a model that captures central challenges in data center computations. Chang et al. PODC2019 gave an extremely fast, constant time, algorithm for the Delta  1coloring problem, where Delta is the maximum degree of an input graph of n nodes. The algorithm works in the most restrictive lowspace setting, where each machine has ndelta local space for a constant 0  delta  1. In this work, we study the vertexcoloring problem in sparse graphs parameterized by their arboricity alpha, a standard measure for sparsity. We give deterministic algorithms that in constant, or almost constant, time give textpolyalpha and Oalphacolorings, where alpha can be arbitrarily smaller than Delta. A strong and standard approach to compute arboricitydependent colorings is through the NashWilliams forest decomposition, which gives rise to an acyclic orientation of the edges such that each node has a small outdegree. Our main technical contribution is giving efficient deterministic algorithms to compute these orientations and showing how to leverage them to find colorings in lowspace AMPC. A key technical challenge is that the color of a node may depend on almost all of the other nodes in the graph and these dependencies cannot be stored on a single machine. Nevertheless, our novel and careful exploration technique yields the orientation, and the arboricitydependent coloring, with a sublinear number of adaptive queries per node.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 12:33:34 UTC (451 KB)"

A core open problem in the field is to prove the existence of linearsize temporal spanners in temporal cliques, i.e., sparse subgraphs of complete temporal graphs that ensure allpairs reachability via temporal paths. So far, the best known result is the existence of temporal spanners with mathcalOnlog n many edges. We present significant progress towards proving that linearsize temporal spanners exist in all temporal cliques. We adapt techniques used in previous works and heavily expand and generalize them to provide a simpler and more intuitive proof of the mathcalOnlog n bound. Moreover, we use our novel approach to show that a large class of temporal cliques, called edgepivot graphs, admit linearsize temporal spanners. To contrast this, we investigate other classes of temporal cliques that do not belong to the class of edgepivot graphs. We introduce two such graph classes and we develop novel techniques for establishing the existence of linear temporal spanners in these graph classes as well.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 08:53:04 UTC (453 KB)"

This allows us to exploit the low dimensional structure and solve the problem to global optimality within reasonable time for large data sets with several clusters. The method builds on iteratively solving a small concave problem and a large linear programming problem. This gives a sequence of feasible solutions along with bounds which we show converges to zero optimality gap.

With the aim to develop bestpossible pseudopolynomialtime algorithms, a recent wave of results has improved Lawler and Moores algorithm for 1sum pj Uj First to time tilde OP74 Bringmann, Fischer, Hermelin, Shabtay, Wellnitz ICALP20, then to time tilde OP53 Klein, Polak, Rohwedder SODA23, and finally to time tilde OP75 Schieber, Sitaraman WADS23.

For kgeq 3, we give a simple integral algorithm which performs better than greedy when the online nodes have bounded degree. As a corollary, it achieves the optimal competitive ratio of 12 on 3uniform hypergraphs when every online node has degree at most 2.

Their algorithm is a clever combination of a number of previously known techniques with a new reduction and a new algorithm for the Orthogonal Vectors problem. In this paper, we give two new algorithms for Subset Sum. We start by presenting an ArthurMerlin algorithm upon receiving the verifiers randomness, the prover sends an n4bit long proof to the verifier who checks it in deterministic time and space O2n4. The simplicity of this algorithm has a number of interesting consequences it can be parallelized easily also, by enumerating all possible proofs, one recovers upper bounds on time and space for Subset Sum proved by Schroeppel and Shamir in 1979. As it is the case with the previously known algorithms for Subset Sum, our algorithm follows from an algorithm for 4SUM we prove that, using verifiers coin tosses, the prover can prepare a log2 nbit long proof verifiable in time tildeOn. Another interesting consequence of this result is the following finegrained lower bound assuming that 4SUM cannot be solved in time On2varepsilon for all varepsilon0, Circuit SAT cannot be solved in time Og21varepsilonn, for all varepsilon0. Then, we improve the space bound by Nederlof and Wgrzycki to O20.246n and also simplify their algorithm and its analysis. We achieve this space bound by further filtering sets of subsets using a random prime number.

The underlying data structures are often port graphs  graphs with labels at edge endpoints. These port labels greatly simplify pattern matching. A prerequisite for graph rewriting is the ability to find subgraphs of the input that match known graph identities the pattern matching problem. We propose a new solution to pattern matching in port graphs. Its novelty lies in the use of a precomputed data structure that makes the pattern matching runtime complexity independent of the number of patterns. The runtime is bound by the maximum width w and depth d of the patterns, as well as the input graph size G as OG cdot cw  w12 cdot d with c  6.75. This offers a significant advantage over existing solutions for use cases where patterns have low width and the set of patterns is large and fixed ahead of time. In the context of quantum circuits, pattern width can be limited to qubit number. Quantum superoptimisers may use thousands of rewrite rules on circuits with less than 5 qubits, making them an ideal use case. We provide benchmarks showing that our algorithm offers a 20x speedup over current implementations on a dataset of 10000 real world patterns describing quantum circuits.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:02:24 UTC (113 KB)"

In this paper, we propose an efficient branchandbound algorithm as well as its taskbased parallel version to enumerate all maximal kplexes with at least q vertices. Our algorithm adopts an effective search space partitioning approach that provides a good time complexity, a new pivot vertex selection method that reduces candidate vertex size, an effective upperbounding technique to prune useless branches, and three novel pruning techniques by vertex pairs. Our parallel algorithm uses a timeout mechanism to eliminate straggler tasks, and maximizes cache locality while ensuring load balancing. Extensive experiments show that compared with the stateoftheart algorithms, our sequential and parallel algorithms enumerate large maximal kplexes with up to 5 times and 18.9 times speedup, respectively. Ablation results also demonstrate that our pruning techniques bring up to 7 times speedup compared with our basic algorithm.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 13:43:16 UTC (680 KB)"
"50","Locally Rainbow Paths","Till Fluschnik, Leon Kellerhals, Malte Renken","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We introduce the algorithmic problem of finding a locally rainbow path of length ell connecting two distinguished vertices s and t in a vertexcolored directed graph. Herein, a path is locally rainbow if between any two visits of equally colored vertices, the path traverses consecutively at least r differently colored vertices. This problem generalizes the wellknown problem of finding a rainbow path. It finds natural applications whenever there are different types of resources that must be protected from overuse, such as crop sequence optimization or production process scheduling. We show that the problem is computationally intractable even if r2 or if one looks for a locally rainbow among the shortest paths. On the positive side, if one looks for a path that takes only a short detour i.e., it is slightly longer than the shortest path and if r is small, the problem can be solved efficiently. Indeed, the running time of the respective algorithm is nearoptimal unless the ETH fails.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 10:50:01 UTC (45 KB)"

Its most prominent line of work is based on the socalled Mapper graph, which is a combinatorial graph whose topological structures connected components, branches, loops are in correspondence with those of the data itself. While highly generic and applicable, its use has been hampered so far by the manual tuning of its many parametersamong these, a crucial one is the socalled filter it is a continuous function whose variations on the data set are the main ingredient for both building the Mapper representation and assessing the presence and sizes of its topological structures. However, while a few parameter tuning methods have already been investigated for the other Mapper parameters i.e., resolution, gain, clustering, there is currently no method for tuning the filter itself. In this work, we build on a recently proposed optimization framework incorporating topology to provide the first filter optimization scheme for Mapper graphs. In order to achieve this, we propose a relaxed and more general version of the Mapper graph, whose convergence properties are investigated. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by optimizing Mapper graph representations on several datasets, and showcasing the superiority of the optimized representation over arbitrary ones.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 09:33:22 UTC (2,650 KB)"

Here we want to enforce that every pair of distinct vertices of distance less than or equal to d have different colors, for integers d geq 1 and k geq d1.

Given an initialization angle theta, we consider warmstarts where the initial state is a product state where each qubit position is angle theta away from either the north or south pole of the Bloch sphere of the two possible qubit positions the position of each qubit is decided by some classically obtained cut encoded as a bitstring b. We illustrate through plots how the properties of b and the initialization angle theta influence the bound on the approximation ratios of warmstarted QAOA. We consider various classical algorithms and the cuts they produce which we use to generate the warmstart. Our results strongly suggest that there does not exist any choice of initialization angle that yields a worstcase approximation ratio that simultaneously beats standard QAOA and the classical algorithm used to create the warmstart. Additionally, we show that at theta60circ, warmstarted QAOA is able to effectively recover the cut used to generate the warmstart, thus suggesting that in practice, this value could be a promising starting angle to explore alternate solutions in a heuristic fashion. Finally, for any combinatorial optimization problem with integervalued objective values, we provide bounds on the required circuit depth needed for warmstarted QAOA to achieve some change in approximation ratio more specifically, we show that for small theta, the bound is roughly proportional to 1theta.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 01:22:07 UTC (2,270 KB)"

This, in turn, implies, in a nonconstructive way, polynomialtime recognition of such classes. However, no constructive algorithms and no specific bounds on the size of forbidden graphs are available up to date.

Our main question is For a given graph H, what is the minimum certificate size that allows checking that the network does not contain H as a possibly induced subgraph? We show a variety of lower and upper bounds, uncovering an interesting interplay between the optimal certificate size, the size of the forbidden subgraph, and the locality of the verification.

Given only the labels of two vertices u,v and of the elements in a faultyset F with Fleq f, one can determine if u,v are connected in GF, the surviving graph after removing F. For the edge or vertex faults models, i.e., Fsubseteq E or Fsubseteq V, a sequence of recent work established schemes with polyf,log nbit labels. This paper considers the color faults model, recently introduced in the context of spanners Petruschka, Sapir and Tzalik, ITCS24, which accounts for known correlations between failures. Here, the edges or vertices of the input G are arbitrarily colored, and the faulty elements in F are colors a failing color causes all edges vertices of that color to crash. Our main contribution is settling the label length complexity for connectivity under one color fault f1. The existing implicit solution, by applying the stateoftheart scheme for edge faults of Dory and Parter, PODC21, might yield labels of Omegan bits. We provide a deterministic scheme with labels of tildeOsqrtn bits in the worst case, and a matching lower bound. Moreover, our scheme is universally optimal even schemes tailored to handle only colorings of one specific graph topology cannot produce asymptotically smaller labels. We extend our labeling approach to yield a routing scheme avoiding a single forbidden color. We also consider the centralized setting, and show an tildeOnspace oracle, answering connectivity queries under one color fault in tildeO1 time. Turning to fgeq 2 color faults, we give a randomized labeling scheme with tildeOn112fbit labels, along with a lower bound of Omegan11f1 bits.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 13:53:13 UTC (362 KB)"

We call a connection between two sites in the spanner a link. In some settings, such as when P is a simple polygon with m vertices and a link is a shortest path in P, links can consist of Theta m segments and thus have nonconstant complexity. The total spanner complexity is a recentlyintroduced measure of how compact a spanner is. In this paper, we study what happens if we are allowed to introduce k Steiner points to reduce the spanner complexity. We study such Steiner spanners in simple polygons, polygonal domains, and edgeweighted trees. Surprisingly, we show that Steiner points have only limited utility. For a spanner that uses k Steiner points, we provide an Omeganmk lower bound on the worstcase complexity of any 3varepsilonspanner, and an Omegamn1t1k1t1 lower bound on the worstcase complexity of any tvarepsilonspanner, for any constant varepsilonin 0,1 and integer constant t geq 2.

One of the most discussed, classification parity, requires that the erroneous classifications of a predictive algorithm occur with equal frequency for groups picked out by protected characteristics. Despite its intuitive appeal, classification parity has come under attack. Multiple scenarios can be imagined in which  intuitively  a predictive algorithm does not treat any individual unfairly, and yet classification parity is violated. To make progress, we turn to a related principle, equal protection, originally developed in the context of criminal justice. Key to equal protection is equalizing the risks of erroneous classifications in a sense to be specified as opposed to equalizing the rates of erroneous classifications. We show that equal protection avoids many of the counterexamples to classification parity, but also fails to model our moral intuitions in a number of common scenarios, for example, when the predictor is causally downstream relative to the protected characteristic. To address these difficulties, we defend a novel principle, causal equal protection, that models the fair allocation of the risks of erroneous classification through the lenses of causality.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 11:30:00 UTC (231 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 22:53:23 UTC (231 KB)"

In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing emphschedules for completing a set of tasks at fixed locations with multiple robots in a laboratory. We represent the laboratory as a graph with tasks placed on fixed vertices and robots represented as agents, with the constraint that no two robots may occupy the same vertex at any given timestep. Each schedule is partitioned into a set of timesteps, corresponding to a walk through the graph allowing for a robot to wait at a vertex to complete a task, with each timestep taking time equal to the time for a robot to move from one vertex to another and each task taking some given number of timesteps during the completion of which a robot must stay at the vertex containing the task. The goal is to determine a set of schedules, with one schedule for each robot, minimising the number of timesteps taken by the schedule taking the greatest number of timesteps within the set of schedules. We show that this problem is NPcomplete for many simple classes of graphs, the problem of determining the fastest schedule, defined by the number of time steps required for a robot to visit every vertex in the schedule and complete every task assigned in its assigned schedule. Explicitly, we provide this result for complete graphs, bipartite graphs, star graphs, and planar graphs. Finally, we provide positive results for line graphs, showing that we can find an optimal set of schedules for k robots completing m tasks of equal length of a path of length n in Okmn time, and a kapproximation when the length of the tasks is unbounded.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 10:28:34 UTC (232 KB)"

In this model, every bidder i has a private signal si for the item for sale, and a public valuation function vis1,ldots,sn which maps every vector of private signals of all bidders into a real value. A recent line of work established the existence of approximatelyoptimal mechanisms within this framework, even in the more challenging scenario where each bidders valuation function vi is also private. This body of work has primarily focused on singleitem auctions with two natural classes of valuations those exhibiting submodularity over signals SOS and dcritical valuations. In this work we advance the state of the art on interdependent values with private valuation functions, with respect to both SOS and dcritical valuations. For SOS valuations, we devise a new mechanism that gives an improved approximation bound of 5 for singleitem auctions. This mechanism employs a novel variant of an eating mechanism, leveraging LPduality to achieve feasibility with reduced welfare loss. For dcritical valuations, we broaden the scope of existing results beyond singleitem auctions, introducing a mechanism that gives a d1approximation for any environment with matroid feasibility constraints on the set of agents that can be simultaneously served.

One central variant we study is MinSum Retrieval MSR where the goal is to minimize the total retrieval costs, while keeping the storage costs bounded. This problem along with its variants was introduced by Bhattacherjee et al. VLDB15. While such problems are frequently encountered in collaborative tools e.g., version control systems and data analysis pipelines, to the best of our knowledge, no existing research studies the theoretical aspects of these problems. We establish that the currently bestknown heuristic, LMG, can perform arbitrarily badly in a simple worst case. Moreover, we show that it is hard to get onapproximation for MSR on general graphs even if we relax the storage constraints by an Olog n factor. Similar hardness results are shown for other variants. Meanwhile, we propose polytime approximation schemes for treelike graphs, motivated by the fact that the graphs arising in practice from typical edit operations are often not arbitrary. As version graphs typically have low treewidth, we further develop new algorithms for bounded treewidth graphs. Furthermore, we propose two new heuristics and evaluate them empirically. First, we extend LMG by considering more potential moves, to propose a new heuristic LMGAll. LMGAll consistently outperforms LMG while having comparable run time on a wide variety of datasets, i.e., version graphs. Secondly, we apply our tree algorithms on the minimumstorage arborescence of an instance, yielding algorithms that are qualitatively better than all previous heuristics for MSR, as well as for another variant BoundedMin Retrieval BMR.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 23:57:03 UTC (1,560 KB)"

We observe an alternative representation for linear deltamatroids, as a contraction representation over a skewsymmetric matrix. This is equivalent to the more standard twist representation up to Onomegatime transformations, but is much more convenient for algorithmic tasks. For instance, the problem of finding a maxweight feasible set now reduces directly to the problem of finding a maxweight basis in a linear matroid. Supported by this representation, we provide new algorithms and constructions over linear deltamatroids. We show that the union and deltasum of linear deltamatroids define linear deltamatroids, and a representation for the resulting deltamatroid can be constructed in randomized time Onomega. Previously, it was only known that these operations define deltamatroids. We also note that every projected linear deltamatroid can be represented as an elementary projection. This implies that several optimization problems over projected linear deltamatroids, including the coverage, deltacoverage, and parity problems, reduce in their decision versions to a single Onomegatime matrix rank computation. Using the methods of Harvey, previously used by Cheung, Lao and Leung for linear matroid parity, we furthermore show how to solve the search versions in the same time. This improves on the On4time augmenting path algorithm of Geelen, Iwata and Murota. Finally, we consider the maximumcardinality deltamatroid intersection problem. Using Storjohanns algorithms for symbolic determinants, we show that such a solution can be found in Onomega1 time.

"74","Probabilistic Routing for Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search","Kejing Lu, Chuan Xiao, Yoshiharu Ishikawa","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Approximate nearest neighbor search ANNS in highdimensional spaces is a pivotal challenge in the field of machine learning. In recent years, graphbased methods have emerged as the superior approach to ANNS, establishing a new state of the art. Although various optimizations for graphbased ANNS have been introduced, they predominantly rely on heuristic methods that lack formal theoretical backing. This paper aims to enhance routing within graphbased ANNS by introducing a method that offers a probabilistic guarantee when exploring a nodes neighbors in the graph. We formulate the problem as probabilistic routing and develop two baseline strategies by incorporating localitysensitive techniques. Subsequently, we introduce PEOs, a novel approach that efficiently identifies which neighbors in the graph should be considered for exact distance computation, thus significantly improving efficiency in practice. Our experiments demonstrate that equipping PEOs can increase throughput on a commonly utilized graph index HNSW by a factor of 1.6 to 2.5, and its efficiency consistently outperforms the leadingedge routing technique by 1.1 to 1.4 times.","Sat, 17 Feb 2024 18:08:37 UTC (308 KB)"

In 2022, Lozin and Razgon completely answered this question for graph classes defined by finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs. Their result also implies a characterization of graph classes defined by finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs that are tw,omegabounded, that is, treewidth can only be large due to the presence of a large clique. This condition is known to be satisfied for any graph class with bounded treeindependence number, a graph parameter introduced independently by Yolov in 2018 and by Dallard, Milani, and torgel in 2024. Dallard et al. conjectured that tw,omegaboundedness is actually equivalent to bounded treeindependence number. We address this conjecture in the context of graph classes defined by finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs and prove it for the case of graph classes excluding an induced star. We also prove it for subclasses of the class of line graphs, determine the exact values of the treeindependence numbers of line graphs of complete graphs and line graphs of complete bipartite graphs, and characterize the treeindependence number of P4free graphs, which implies a lineartime algorithm for its computation.

In these problems, the input is a directed graph on n nodes, and the m edges arrive one by one. The data structure must maintain a topological ordering of the vertices at all times and detect if the newly inserted edge creates a cycle. The theoretically best worstcase algorithms for these problems have high update cost polynomial in n and m. In practice, greedy heuristics that recompute the solution from scratch each time perform well but can have high update cost in the worst case. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging predictions to design a learned new data structure for the problems. Our data structure guarantees consistency, robustness, and smoothness with respect to predictions  that is, it has the best possible running time under perfect predictions, never performs worse than the bestknown worstcase methods, and its running time degrades smoothly with the prediction error. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that predictions, learned from a very small training dataset, are sufficient to provide significant speedups on real datasets.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 19:18:51 UTC (2,613 KB)"

For graph network design problems where the goal is to construct a graph that satisfies certain connectivity requirements, the number of edges in every feasible solution is at most quadratic in the number of vertices. In contrast, for hypergraph network design problems, we might have feasible solutions in which the number of hyperedges is exponential in the number of vertices. This presents an additional technical challenge in hypergraph network design problems compared to graph network design problems in order to solve the problem in polynomial time, we first need to show that there exists a feasible solution in which the number of hyperedges is polynomial in the input size. The central theme of this work is to show that certain hypergraph network design problems admit solutions in which the number of hyperedges is polynomial in the number of vertices and moreover, can be solved in strongly polynomial time. Our work improves on the previous fastest pseudopolynomial runtime for these problems. In addition, we develop strongly polynomial time algorithms that return nearuniform hypergraphs as solutions i.e., every pair of hyperedges differ in size by at most one. As applications of our results, we derive the first strongly polynomial time algorithms for i degreespecified hypergraph connectivity augmentation using hyperedges, ii degreespecified hypergraph nodetoarea connectivity augmentation using hyperedges, and iii degreeconstrained mixedhypergraph connectivity augmentation using hyperedges.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 17:58:58 UTC (219 KB)"

Given a binary constraint graph G and its two satisfying assignments psimathsfini and psimathsftar, the Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration problem requests to transform psimathsfini into psimathsftar by repeatedly changing the value of a single vertex so that the minimum fraction of satisfied edges is maximized. We demonstrate a polynomialtime reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration with arbitrarily large alphabet size W in mathbbN to itself with universal alphabet size W0 in mathbbN such that 1. the perfect completeness is preserved, and 2. if any reconfiguration for the former violates varepsilonfraction of edges, then Omegavarepsilonfraction of edges must be unsatisfied during any reconfiguration for the latter. The crux of its construction is the reconfigurability of Hadamard codes, which enables to reconfigure between a pair of codewords, while avoiding getting too close to the other codewords. Combining this alphabet reduction with gap amplification due to Ohsaka SODA 2024, we are able to amplify the 1 vs. 1varepsilon gap for arbitrarily small varepsilon in 0,1 up to the 1 vs. 1varepsilon0 for some universal varepsilon0 in 0,1 without blowing up the alphabet size.

In fact, our learningaugmented skip list is still optimal up to a constant factor, even if the oracle is only accurate within a constant factor. We show that if the search queries follow the ubiquitous Zipfian distribution, then the expected search time for an item by our skip list is only a constant, independent of the total number n of items, i.e., mathcalO1, whereas a traditional skip list will have an expected search time of mathcalOlog n. We also demonstrate robustness by showing that our data structure achieves an expected search time that is within a constant factor of an oblivious skip list construction even when the predictions are arbitrarily incorrect. Finally, we empirically show that our learningaugmented skip list outperforms traditional skip lists on both synthetic and realworld datasets.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 05:27:13 UTC (3,927 KB)"

Furthermore, the learnability of such problems can fail to be a property of finite character informally, it cannot be detected by examining finite projections of the problem. On the other hand, learning theory abounds with notions of dimension that characterize learning and consider only finite restrictions of the problem, i.e., are properties of finite character. How can these results be reconciled? More precisely, which classes of learning problems are vulnerable to logical undecidability, and which are within the grasp of finite characterizations? We demonstrate that the difficulty of supervised learning with metric losses admits a tight finite characterization. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of learning a hypothesis class can be detected by examining its finite projections. For realizable and agnostic learning with respect to a wide class of proper loss functions, we demonstrate an exact compactness result a class is learnable with a given sample complexity precisely when the same is true of all its finite projections. For realizable learning with improper loss functions, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ.

Yet, much potential in this direction remains untapped, as most subsequent work applied it without further advancement. Motivated by this, we present piecewise analysis, a new general method that analyzes the running time of branching algorithms. Our approach is to define a similarity ratio that divides instances into groups and then analyze the running time within each group separately. The similarity ratio is a scale between two parameters of an instance I. Instead of relying on a single measure and a single analysis for the whole instance space, our method allows to take advantage of different intrinsic properties of instances with different similarity ratios.

We present a simple adversary that can, under mild assumptions on the initial point set, provably find a query to the approximate near neighbor search data structure that the data structure fails on. Crucially, our adaptive algorithm finds the hard query exponentially faster than random sampling.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 04:58:35 UTC (3,735 KB)"

With proper predictions, RobustSL has optimal consistency achieves static optimality. At the same time, it maintains a logarithmic running time for each operation, ensuring optimal robustness, even if predictions are generated adversarially. Therefore, RobustSL has all the advantages of the recent learningaugmented data structures of Lin, Luo, and Woodruff ICML 2022 and Cao et al. arXiv 2023, while providing robustness guarantees that are absent in the previous work.

We use this Markov chain to construct a complex Hermitian Laplacian matrix  the magnetic Laplacian  which serves as the input to our proposed hypergraph neural network. We study HyperMagNet for the task of node classification, and demonstrate its effectiveness over graphreduction based hypergraph neural networks.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 03:05:45 UTC (300 KB)"
"101","Unbalanced Random Matching Markets with Partial Preferences","Aditya Potukuchi, Shikha Singh","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Properties of stable matchings in the popular randommatchingmarket model have been studied for over 50 years. In a random matching market, each agent has complete preferences drawn uniformly and independently at random. Wilson 1972, Knuth 1976 and Pittel 1989 proved that in balanced random matching markets, the proposers are matched to their ln nth choice on average. In this paper, we consider markets where agents have partial truncated preferences, that is, the proposers only rank their top d partners. Despite the long history of the problem, the following fundamental question remained unanswered emphwhat is the smallest value of d that results in a perfect stable matching with high probability? In this paper, we answer this question exactly  we prove that a degree of ln2 n is necessary and sufficient. That is, we show that if d  1epsilon ln2 n then no stable matching is perfect and if d  1 epsilon ln2 n, then every stable matching is perfect with high probability. This settles a recent conjecture by Kanoria, Min and Qian 2021. We generalize this threshold for unbalanced markets we consider a matching market with n agents on the shorter side and nalpha1 agents on the longer side. We show that for markets with alpha o1, the sharp threshold characterizing the existence of perfect stable matching occurs when d is ln n cdot ln leftfrac1  alphaalpha  1nalpha1 right. Finally, we extend the line of work studying the effect of imbalance on the expected rank of the proposers termed the stark effect of competition. We establish the regime in unbalanced markets that forces this stark effect to take shape in markets with partial preferences.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 02:27:51 UTC (47 KB)"

The current delimitation exercise suffers from a number of drawbacks viz. inefficiency, gerrymandering and an uneven seattopopulation ratio, owing to existing legal and constitutional dictates. The existing methods allocate seats to every state but remain silent about their actual shape and location within the state. The main purpose of this research is to study and analyse the performance of existing delimitation algorithms and further propose a potential solution, along with its merits, that involves using a computational model based on the quadtree data structure to automate the districting process by optimizing objective population criteria. The paper presents an approach to electoral delimitation using the quadtree data structure, which is used to partition a twodimensional geographical space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions on the basis of population as a parameter value associated with the node. The quadtree makes use of a quadrant schema of the geographical space for representing constituencies, which not only keeps count of the allocated constituencies but also holds their locationspecific information. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analysed and evaluated against existing techniques and proves to be an efficient solution in terms of algorithmic complexity and boundary visualisation to the process of political districting.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 17:32:57 UTC (484 KB)[v2] Fri, 16 Feb 2024 14:24:53 UTC (484 KB)"

Until now, the most efficient construction of unitary Tdesigns for nqudit systems has been via random local quantum circuits, which have been shown to converge to approximate Tdesigns in the diamond norm using OT5o1 n2 quantum gates. In this work, we provide a new construction of Tdesigns via random matrix theory using tildeOT2 n2 quantum gates. Our construction leverages two key ideas. First, in the spirit of central limit theorems, we approximate the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble GUE by an i.i.d. sum of random Hermitian matrices. Second, we show that the product of just two exponentiated GUE matrices is already approximately Haar random. Thus, multiplying two exponentiated sums over rather simple random matrices yields a unitary Tdesign, via Hamiltonian simulation. A central feature of our proof is a new connection between the polynomial method in quantum query complexity and the largedimension N expansion in random matrix theory. In particular, we show that the polynomial method provides exponentially improved bounds on the high moments of certain random matrix ensembles, without requiring intricate Weingarten calculations. In doing so, we define and solve a new type of moment problem on the unit circle, asking whether a finite number of equally weighted points, corresponding to eigenvalues of unitary matrices, can reproduce a given set of moments.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 17:32:30 UTC (232 KB)"

Such representations are naturally encoded by a sequence graph whose vertices are the distinct words occurring in x, with edges representing the ordered cooccurrence of two words within a sliding window of size w. However, this compressed representation is not generally bijective, and may introduce some degree of ambiguity. Some sequence graphs may admit several realizations as a sequence, while others may not admit any realization. In this paper, we study the realizability and ambiguity of sequence graphs from a combinatorial and computational point of view. We consider the existence and enumeration of realizations of a sequence graph under multiple settings window size w, presenceabsence of graph orientation, and presenceabsence of weights multiplicities. When w  2, we provide polynomial time algorithms for realizability and enumeration in all cases except the undirectedweighted setting, where we show the Phardness of enumeration. For a window of size at least 3, we prove hardness of all variants, even when w is considered as a constant, with the notable exception of the undirectedunweighted case for which we propose an XP algorithms for both realizability and enumeration problems, tight due to a corresponding W1hardness result. We conclude with an integer program formulation to solve the realizability problem, and with dynamic programming to solve the enumeration problem. This work leaves open the membership to NP for both problems, a nontrivial question due to the existence of minimum realizations having exponential size on the instance encoding.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 22:22:51 UTC (71 KB)"

Highaccuracy sketches with low memory overhead have become the de facto method for analyzing this data.

Similarly, if we wish to keep track of the number of distinct items in a single set spread across several streams using fixed memory, we can turn to mergeable count distinct sketches that can provide highly accurate set cardinalities. If we were to try to keep track of the cardinality of multiple sets and report only on the largest ones, maintaining individual count distinct sketches for each set can grow unwieldy, especially if the number of sets is not known in advance. We consider the natural combination of the heavy hitters problem with the count distinct problem, the heavy distinct hitters problem given a stream of ell, x pairs, find all the labels ell that are paired with a large number of distinct items x using only constant memory.

In this work, we study the following foundational question Are there notions of multiclass calibration that give strong guarantees of meaningful predictions and can be achieved in time and sample complexities polynomial in k? Prior notions of calibration exhibit a tradeoff between computational efficiency and expressivity they either suffer from having sample complexity exponential in k, or needing to solve computationally intractable problems, or give rather weak guarantees. Our main contribution is a notion of calibration that achieves all these desiderata we formulate a robust notion of projected smooth calibration for multiclass predictions, and give new recalibration algorithms for efficiently calibrating predictors under this definition with complexity polynomial in k. Projected smooth calibration gives strong guarantees for all downstream decision makers who want to use the predictor for binary classification problems of the form does the label belong to a subset T subseteq k e.g. is this an image of an animal? It ensures that the probabilities predicted by summing the probabilities assigned to labels in T are close to some perfectly calibrated binary predictor for that task. We also show that natural strengthenings of our definition are computationally hard to achieve they run into information theoretic barriers or computational intractability. Underlying both our upper and lower bounds is a tight connection that we prove between multiclass calibration and the wellstudied problem of agnostic learning in the standard binary prediction setting.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 17:25:23 UTC (57 KB)"

While it is relatively well understood how quantum walks can speed up random walk hitting times, it is a longstanding open question to what extent quantum walks can speed up the spreading or mixing rate of random walks on graphs. In this expository paper, inspired by a blog post by Terence Tao, we describe a particular perspective on this question that derives quantum walks from the discrete wave equation on graphs. This yields a description of the quantum walk dynamics as simply applying a Chebyshev polynomial to the random walk transition matrix. This perspective decouples the problem from its quantum origin, and highlights connections to earlier nonquantum work and the use of Chebyshev polynomials in random walk theory as in the VaropoulosCarne bound. We illustrate the approach by proving a weak limit of the quantum walk dynamics on the lattice. This gives a different proof of the quadratically improved spreading behavior of quantum walks on lattices.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 17:15:19 UTC (44 KB)"

Our primary contribution is an algorithm with runtime OnDkGkcdot nm for this problem. Here, G le D represents the number of maximal wildcard fragments in P. We derive this algorithm by elaborating in a nontrivial way on the ideas presented by Charalampopoulos et al., FOCS20 for pattern matching with mismatches without wildcards. Our algorithm improves over the state of the art when D, G, and k are small relative to n. For instance, if m  n2, kGn25, and Dn35, our algorithm operates in On time, surpassing the Omegan65 time requirement of all previously known algorithms. In the case of exact pattern matching with wildcards k0, we present a much simpler algorithm with runtime OnDGcdot nm that clearly illustrates our main technical innovation the utilisation of positions of P that do not belong to any fragment of P with a density of wildcards much larger than Dm as anchors for the sought approximate occurrences.

To date, triggered by some positive approximability results, a large body of work has been devoted to studying centrality maximization, where the goal is to maximize the centrality score of a target vertex by manipulating the structure of a given network. On the other hand, due to the lack of such results, only very little attention has been paid to centrality minimization, despite its practical usefulness. In this study, we introduce a novel optimization model for local centrality minimization, where the manipulation is allowed only around the target vertex. We prove the NPhardness of our model and that the most intuitive greedy algorithm has a quite limited performance in terms of approximation ratio. Then we design two effective approximation algorithms The first algorithm is a highlyscalable algorithm that has an approximation ratio unachievable by the greedy algorithm, while the second algorithm is a bicriteria approximation algorithm that solves a continuous relaxation based on the Lovsz extension, using a projected subgradient method. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first polynomialtime algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for centrality minimization. Experiments using a variety of realworld networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms Our first algorithm is applicable to millionscale graphs and obtains much better solutions than those of scalable baselines, while our second algorithm is rather strong against adversarial instances.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 15:32:48 UTC (336 KB)"

Royer","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","The difficulty of minimizing a nonconvex function is in part explained by the presence of saddle points. This slows down optimization algorithms and impacts worstcase complexity guarantees. However, many nonconvex problems of interest possess a favorable structure for optimization, in the sense that saddle points can be escaped efficiently by appropriate algorithms. This strict saddle property has been extensively used in data science to derive good properties for firstorder algorithms, such as convergence to secondorder critical points. However, the analysis and the design of secondorder algorithms in the strict saddle setting have received significantly less attention. In this paper, we consider secondorder trustregion methods for a class of strict saddle functions defined on Riemannian manifolds. These functions exhibit geodesic strong convexity around minimizers and negative curvature at saddle points. We show that the standard trustregion method with exact subproblem minimization finds an approximate local minimizer in a number of iterations that depends logarithmically on the accuracy parameter, which significantly improves known results for general nonconvex optimization. We also propose an inexact variant of the algorithm that explicitly leverages the strict saddle property to compute the most appropriate step at every iteration. Our bounds for the inexact variant also improve over the general nonconvex case, and illustrate the benefit of using strict saddle properties within optimization algorithms.

This is analogous to a calibration measure recently proposed by Basiok, Gopalan, Hu and Nakkiran STOC 2023 for the offline setting. The calibration distance is a natural and intuitive measure of deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies a Lipschitz continuity property which does not hold for many popular calibration measures, such as the L1 calibration error and its variants. We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an OsqrtT calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of T binary outcomes. At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. We then show that an OsqrtT lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz class. On the lower bound side, an OmegaT13 calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps. Interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of mathrmpolylogT.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 07:37:19 UTC (44 KB)"

The breakthrough FlashAttention algorithm revealed IO complexity as the true bottleneck in scaling Transformers. Given two levels of memory hierarchy, a fast cache e.g. GPU onchip SRAM and a slow memory e.g. GPU highbandwidth memory, the IO complexity measures the number of accesses to memory. FlashAttention computes attention using fracN2d2M IO operations where N is the dimension of the attention matrix, d the headdimension and M the cache size. However, is this IO complexity optimal? The known lower bound only rules out an IO complexity of oNd when MThetaNd, since the output that needs to be written to slow memory is OmegaNd. This leads to the main question of our work Is FlashAttention IO optimal for all values of M? We resolve the above question in its full generality by showing an IO complexity lower bound that matches the upper bound provided by FlashAttention for any values of M geq d2 within any constant factors. Further, we give a better algorithm with lower IO complexity for M  d2, and show that it is optimal as well. Moreover, our lower bounds do not rely on using combinatorial matrix multiplication for computing the attention matrix. We show even if one uses fast matrix multiplication, the above IO complexity bounds cannot be improved. We do so by introducing a new communication complexity protocol for matrix compression, and connecting communication complexity to IO complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish a connection between communication complexity and IO complexity, and we believe this connection could be of independent interest and will find many more applications in proving IO complexity lower bounds in the future.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 06:50:45 UTC (66 KB)"

Typically, the naive approach for obtaining LSH for tensor data involves first reshaping the tensor into vectors, followed by applying existing LSH methods for vector data E2LSH and SRP. However, this approach becomes impractical for higher order tensors because the size of the reshaped vector becomes exponential in the order of the tensor. Consequently, the size of LSH parameters increases exponentially. To address this problem, we suggest two methods for LSH for Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, namely CPE2LSH, TTE2LSH, and CPSRP, TTSRP, respectively, building on CP and tensor train TT decompositions techniques.

We also present computational complexity results that highlight the limits on the generalizability of our results. We evaluate the algorithms developed in our work with experiments on both realworld and synthetic data sets with respect to drought severity, value functions, and seniority of agents.","Fri, 9 Feb 2024 17:50:40 UTC (4,584 KB)[v2] Mon, 12 Feb 2024 02:17:04 UTC (4,657 KB)"
